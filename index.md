I work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI (Neuro-AI). We build encoding models using modern machine
learning and deep neural networks that predict neural activity to better understand computations in the brain. These
models can also serve as “digital twins” on which we perform in silico experiments to reveal the selectivity of
different units. We also are building state of the art decoding models to reconstruct perceived stimuli from brain
activity. In other work, I study how the visual system combines top-down and attention modulations with bottom-up
and lateral connectivity to efficiently group visual input into objects and reveal mechanisms of face perception.

Previously, I was a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Eye Cognition Lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/zelinsky/who-we-are/) at Stony Brook University psychology department, where I had also recieved my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science.  

<!-- My research focuses on using computational and behavioral tools and through collaboration neural recording  to study the relationship between recognition, attention and grouping. -->
