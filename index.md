Hossein Adeli 

Senior Postdoctoral Fellow 

Cognitive Science, Ph.D.

Eye Cognition Lab 

Computer Vision Lab

Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 

I am a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in the psychology department  at Stony Brook University.  My research focuses on using computational and behavioral tools and through collaboration neural recording  to study the relationship between recognition, attention and grouping. 

I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from Stony Brook University. My work was focused on understanding and developing computational models of the attention mechanisms of visual search and object recognition (for example how one searches in a scene for a friend's face and recognizes that face).  I built a large scale cortical computational model of attention using deep neural networks (DNNs) and also exploring how attention mechanisms built into DNNs can improve their performance.
