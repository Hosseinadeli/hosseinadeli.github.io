I am a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in the psychology department  at Stony Brook University.  My research focuses on using computational and behavioral tools and through collaboration neural recording  to study the relationship between recognition, attention and grouping. 

I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from Stony Brook University. My work was focused on understanding and developing computational models of the attention mechanisms of visual search and object recognition (for example how one searches in a scene for a friend's face and recognizes that face).  I built a large scale cortical computational model of attention using deep neural networks (DNNs) and also exploring how attention mechanisms built into DNNs can improve their performance. 

I received my bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran and Master’s degree in Computer Science from East Carolina University, NC where I worked on generating textual description for natural images using state of the art computer vision algorithms.
